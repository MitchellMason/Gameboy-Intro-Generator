# Gameboy-Intro-Generator
Creates a GIF of text that looks like a Game Boy Color boot sequence.
Currently made for programmers that can edit the data, not end-users.

# Instructions
To use, simply edit the TITLE, SUBTITLE, and color palette as desired.
Once the sketch is run, a gif will be generated in the sketch folder if `SAVEGIF` is set to `true`,
and individual frames can be saved if `SAVEFRAMES` is set.
This is useful if you want to create a video using processing's build in movie maker tool. 

# Credits
Built on [Processing](https://processing.org).

The subtitle font is a slightly modified version of [this](https://www.dafont.com/early-gameboy.font).
